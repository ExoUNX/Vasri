# Vasri
Easy subresource integrity and versioning for local assets

This is also meant to replace the Laravel Mix helper.

## Install

```
composer require exounx/vasri
```

Publish the config
```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="ExoUNX\Vasri\Providers\VasriServiceProvider"
```

## Usage

Note: If you use a CDN like Cloudflare that processes your assets at their edge servers, I recommend you disable it and process your scripts beforehand otherwise resources may not load

You'll need to generate the manifest first by running the following command

```
php artisan vasri:build
```

For CSS

```
<link rel="stylesheet" {!! vasri('/css/app.css') !!}/>
```

For JS

```
<script {!! vasri('/js/app.js') !!}></script>
```

By default Vasri is configured to read the mix-manifest.json in your public Laravel directory.

If you don't wish to use the mix manifest you can disable it in the config

```
'mix-manifest' => false,
```

You'll need to specify your assets manually in the config if you disable mix-manifest support

```
'assets' => [
    '/css/app.css',
    '/js/app.js',
]
```
